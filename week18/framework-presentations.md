#Framework Lightning Talks

On Friday afternoon, instead of working on your projects or having lecture time,
every student will give a lightning talk (5-10 minutes) on a related topic. The
purpose for this is three-fold:

- Allow students to explore things that interest them the most
- Share the information from this exploration with their classmates
- Practice giving presentations about tech in a low-pressure environment to a friendly audience

Consider this your homework for the next two weeks.

This is NOT meant to be a big huge research project. This is meant to allow you to explore
what interests you and to present the results of this exploration to your classmates. I expect
you to spend a few hours working on this presentation over the course of a few weeks--we're
talking 2-5 here, not 20-30.

##What I want
- A [Google Docs presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation) (this is similar to PowerPoint)
    - A link to this Google Docs presentation should be emailed to me by noon on Friday
    - Doesn't have to have a bajillion beautiful pictures or custom font or anything
    - Should aid your presentation, not distract from it
    - Cat/dog/dinosaur pictures are a plus, provided they don't squish relevant info off the page
- A brief outline of the issue you are discussing with enough information to
    - BS my way through an interview
    - Know what to Google in the bathroom at a networking event
    - Have a general impression about whether I (the listener) might want to pursue that issue
- Appropriately complex/simple information for your classmates as an audience
- You to be prepared to answer some simple questions from classmates about your topic
    - No one expects you to be an expert. It's okay if your answers are "I don't know"
- You to email me or talk with me by next week Tuesday with any concerns. These include:
    - Extreme stage fright 
    - Concerns about fulfilling the assignment
    - Concerns about finding a topic

##What I do NOT want
- You to tear your hair out about this project
- Presentations longer than 10 minutes
    - Exception: groups of 2, which will take 10-20 minutes
    - I will be timing you
- Overly complex presentations that rely on knowledge your classmates don't have
- An email from anyone with serious concerns about presenting by next week Tuesday
- An email from anyone for whom presenting near the beginning/end of class will make a SIGNIFICANT difference in their quality of life by next week Tuesday
- Anyone falling asleep during presentations. Please be attentive and respectful.

On Friday, starting at 1pm, we'll watch the presentations and learn from each other.
We'll spend the rest of our class time in this way. It's possible that there will be
snacks :D
